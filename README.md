# **Top Down Ninja**

In this project I will be looking to make a simple 3D and *unique* top down shooter type game using the engine Unity. I will be coding the game Using C# and will also be using many of unity's properties to help make the game. The game will be of a Ninja that has too take down multiple Mall cops using just their skills and weaponry. 


## Why did I choose this to do?

I chose to do Unity as my project because of a few reasons:
* 1. This would have me learn an entirely new coding language which would push myself into learning more.
* 2. I have never worked in the third dimension in coding before so this would broaden my reach of what I can do.
* 3. I have never used unity before and wanted to learn how to use it to help myself in the future.


## A demo of My project

My project is currently **Unfinished** and is in a general working state, but I am able to move at a fast pace when it comes to it and am almost complete with my roadmap of where I thought I would be at this point.
