### **Top Down Ninja**

In this project I will be looking to make a simple 3D and *unique* top down shooter type game using the engine Unity. I will be coding the game Using C# and will also be using many of unity's properties to help make the game. The game will be of a Ninja that has too take down multiple Mall cops using just their skills and weaponry. 

## Why did I choose this to do?

I chose to do Unity as my project because of a few reasons:
* 1. This would have me learn an entirely new coding language
* 2. I have never worked in the third dimension in coding before 
* 3. I have never used unity before and wanted to learn how to use it to help myself in the future
